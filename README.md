# raspi_garden
Ideally a Python script to continuously update temperature and humidity information from a couple of sensors hooked to a Pi Zero, for gardening!

Here' the hypothetical to-do list: 
1. Buy a pair of inexpensive sensors and connect via GPIO, read outputs per manual or just from bytestream 
2. Write code to parse sensor output and format correctly
3. Loop parser to constantly output formatted temperature & humidity data
4. Pump data to a website!
5. Add support for a wider range of sensors (soil moisture?)
6. *Ultimate goal* Add a servo motor to the apparatus that controls a water spigot, adjust soil moisture/humidity on the fly for an at-home garden that can be maintained from anywhere :)
